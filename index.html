            <h2> Billionare Bruce Wayne</h2>
            <div id="grad1">
              <p>
            Bruce was born to Thomas and Martha Wayne. Bruce's parents celebrated his second birthday. Bruce and his family 
            went camping in a forest. He and his father climbed a tree and ate oranges, while his mother sang 
            to herself while building a fire. Bruce and his father had a yearly tradition of taking a hike, placing rocks at 
            the top of a peak, and watching the sunrise in the morning. Whenever he gets sick, his mother would stay with him and 
            read to him until he fell asleep. On his seventh birthday, about fifty kids came over to celebrate, but Bruce was off 
            outside on his own, obsessed with the bright red wagon that his father gave him as a present. He spent the whole day in 
            the garden collecting rocks with his wagon, and when he was asked by Alfred  what he was going to do with them Bruce told
            him "I'm gonna build a home for my wagon, a secret place, that only I know about". When he was seven years old, he rowed his 
            boat in a middle of a storm and it greatly frightened his father and Alfred. When he came back, his father cried tears of joy
            and hugged him.</p>  <br> <br>
            <h2> The Bat Is Fear Itself </h2>
            <div id="grad1"> 
               <p>Bruce Wayne returned to Gotham City after many years of study and training with his body and mind developed to perfection. Despite having all of the skills
               and methods to fight crime, he still felt that there was something missing in the completion of his physical and mental arsenal. Wayne discovered the answer late
               one night while sitting in his manor. He recalled his fear of bats as a child after a large one crashed through one of the windows; he ultimately decided to make 
               his appearance resemble a bat's. Wayne designed himself a costume equipped with experimental technology and set out against the crime and corruption that thrived in Gotham City.
               Wayne's tactics to oppose crime as a vigilante at night proved successful leading him to become an urban legend in Gotham City. He revealed himself at a dinner of the most 
               influential and corrupt figures in Gotham City and promised them all that their reigns on the city would eventually end. Wayne's first ally was assistant district attorney Harvey Dent.
               Most of the Gotham City Police Department was sent in force to capture him.He gained his most powerful ally when he met police lieutenant James Gordon, one of the few honest cops 
               on the force. The two developed a working relationship operating outside of the law when they needed to.</p><br>
